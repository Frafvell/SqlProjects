# LaundryPertamina SQL Project  
This project is my personal learning journey in SQL.  
I will update this project regularly with my progress, structured as follows:  

## ðŸ“… File Naming Convention  
Each update will be saved with the format:  
**`database_project_YYYY-MM-DD.sql`**  
Example:  
- `database_project_2025-02-27.sql` (todayâ€™s progress)  
- `database_project_2025-02-28.sql` (next update)  

## ðŸš€ Goals  
- Learn SQL fundamentals (DDL, DML, DCL, etc.)  
- Understand database relationships (FK, constraints, etc.)  
- Build a structured and scalable database
